Hey! Let me tell you about this cool React code editor I've been working on. It's basically like Playcode's React editor, but web-based, and it shows you your code changes in real-time.

So, what can it do? Well, you can see your React code running live as you type, and it uses Monaco Editor (you know, the same engine that powers VS Code). You can manage your packages, browse through files, and it's got this nice split-view setup. Oh, and of course it has all the usual stuff like syntax highlighting and runs your code instantly.

Want to try it out? Here's what you'll need to get started:
- Just make sure you've got Node.js and npm installed first.

Setting it up is pretty straightforward:
1. Just grab the code from the repo and hop into the project folder
2. Run `npm install` to get all the dependencies
3. Then `npm run dev` to fire it up

Once you do that, just head over to localhost:5173 in your browser and you're good to go!

Using it is super simple - you've got your main editor where you write your React code, a preview window right below it to see what your code's doing, a file explorer to jump between files, and a package manager if you need to add any npm packages.

We built it using some pretty solid tech - React.js, JavaScript, Monaco Editor, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.

Want to help out? Awesome! Just fork the repo, create a branch for your changes (something like `feature/amazing-feature`), make your updates, commit them, push them up, and open a PR. We'd love to see what you come up with!
